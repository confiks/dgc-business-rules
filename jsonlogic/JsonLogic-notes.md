# JsonLogic


## Implementations

* JavaScript: https://github.com/jwadhams/json-logic-js/
* Swift: https://github.com/advantagefse/json-logic-swift
* Kotlin:
    * https://github.com/advantagefse/json-logic-kotlin (download on GitHub not working, building not working out-of-the-box, [binary here](http://maven.malltest.liqiang365.com/artifactory/hotax/eu/afse/eu.afse.jsonlogic/0.9.6/))
    * https://github.com/deinspanjer/json-logic-java ("advertised" as Java, but 100% Kotlin) - seems to be wrapping the JS implementation
* Java:
    * https://github.com/jamsesso/json-logic-java
    * https://johnzon.apache.org/#JSON_Logic
* Go:
    * https://github.com/GeorgeD19/json-logic-go

* Rust: https://github.com/Bestowinc/json-logic-rs


## Alternatives

* https://github.com/CacheControl/json-rules-engine: but JS-only, not cross-platform


## Tests

[Official unit tests](https://jsonlogic.com/tests.json), apparently also used to test the Kotlin implementation from `advantagefse`.
However, that set is not complete, especially with regards to edge case behaviour involving "degenerate" values like `null`, `{}`, `[]`, etc.
